        Toddlers United for Freedom is a non profit organization run by toddlers.&nbsp; 
        Founded by Elaine Allison Crowell in 2009 with a simple goal, to help empower 
        toddlers and give them the voice and the tools to take charge.&nbsp; All 
        toddlers have the ability to rule their households.&nbsp; We have the program to 
        show them how to do it.&nbsp; Our training sessions and organized activities are 
        designed to give voice to the toddler cause.</p>
